MOVIE REVIEWS

This application allows users to read and write movie reviews. 
in Addition to reading and writing reviews, the users also have the capability to edit a review to make it their own. 
I created this project using react app and many different componants that all link together to produce one project. This app allows users to look at exsisting reviews that were made by previouse users. This app also allows user to write his or hers own review and have it saved on the website for other users to see. 
I used many hooks in my project to make it clean and easy to read. I have used useHistory in order for my app to go back to the previous pages within the app. I used this beacuse once a review is written the user has to go back to the previous page to be able to see his review displayed on the main page. I used useState in order for my app to be able to save the changes the the user makes. For example, when the user writes a review it will save the changes and display them. I used useParams to help me grab objects and use them later on in the code.
Some of the challenges I face during this project was that I did not plan everything for the project out before starting on it. This caused me to slow down and constantly had to change things so that it matched in the end. 
For my next project, I will plan everything out prior to starting the project. This will make it alot eaiser when it comes time to actually write the code.
